## Description 
    For this project I implemented 3 classes to translate orginal english text into robber language. I used the model class to encode every non-vowelcharacter  by doubling and placing an "o" in between, per the robber language rules. I implemented boolean functions isVowel and isConsonant in the model class and translator to help simplify my logic for determing the type of character before encoding and forming the words. Having the helper functions made it easier for me to handle casing and encapsulate the process of determing the character type. In the fileprocessor class I directly incorporated the html tags to format in bold/italic within the processfile method without use of helper functions because I kept the html structure to just a header and the 2 for the original text and translated text.
