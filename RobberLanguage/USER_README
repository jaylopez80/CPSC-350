## Description 
  For this project I implemented 3 classes to translate original english text into robber language. I used the model class to encode every non-vowel 
character  by doubling and placing an "o" in between, per the robber language rules. I implemented boolean functions isVowel and isConsonant in the model
class and translator to help simplify my logic for determining the type of character before encoding and forming the words. Having the helper functions
made it easier for me to handle casing and encapsulate the process of determing the character type. In the fileprocessor class I directly 
incorporated the html tags to format in bold/italic within the processfile method without use of helper functions because I kept the html to just a
header and the 2 for the original text and translated text.
